# GIT/GITHUB Workshop
I would like to show you the basics of the distributed version control system "git" and how it can be used in conjunctions with the social coding platform "github".

Intended for people or hackers who code only occasionally rather than full blown software developers. My goal is to get contributors and members of our hackerspace to share their material on github so that the rest of us can reuse and improve it.

If you don't just want to listen, bring your laptop.

Free if you are or join as Dimsumlabs member and HKD 200 for non-members. Fees are donated to Dimsumlabs and used to decrease our monthly deficit.
